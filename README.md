# PoneDM
Based off of [Source SDK 2013 CE](https://github.com/Nbc66/source-sdk-2013-ce).
Inspired by [Bear Party Adventure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274450/Bear_Party_Adventure/), PoneDM is a shitpost mod taken too seriously. 
Created by the same person who made Intellectual Techno Hell and FIREFIGHT RELOADED, PoneDM is an experimental multiplayer arena shooter that pits you against other colorful horses in various arenas. 
You can fight against bots, or you can fight with other players around the world. 
You will be able to traverse many areas by bunny-hopping and rocket jumping through them as you try to completely destroy the enemy team, or against other players in free-for-all romps. 
You can also customize your horse with various colors, mane, and tail styles. 

This mod was explicitly built so I can refresh my knowledge of the Source Engine and experiment with various aspects I haven't yet experimented with in other mods I worked on in the past. 
I also wanted to create an engaging experience like Intellectual Techno Hell: a shitposty feeling mod that is fun to play while also balanced enough to be taken seriously.
