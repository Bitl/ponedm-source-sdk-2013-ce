# PoneDM
Based off of [Source SDK 2013 CE](https://github.com/Nbc66/source-sdk-2013-ce).
Inspired by [Bear Party Adventure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274450/Bear_Party_Adventure/), PoneDM is a non-serious deathmatch mod where colorful horses fight in familiar arenas with insane weapons.

* Play in arenas from many Valve multiplayer games using the mounting system!
* Many weapons to find and use!
* Customizable ponies!
* Fast speed!
* Bunnyhops!

In addition, PoneDM allows for players to increase or decrease the amount of graphic violence depicted in the mod, allowing for a wider target audience. The graphic violence has been disabled by default.

NOTE: This is just something I made for fun to practice my Source Engine skills for FIREFIGHT RELOADED. This isn't a serious project I wish to work on a lot.
